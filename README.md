# CyberCareersMindmap
This project is an exercise in enumerating the various roles and specialties within cybersecurity.

Additions can be requested by opening an issue. Please do not submit a pull request.

The mind map is structured as follows:
- Defenders represent the roles and specializations within the teams that protect organizations.
- Products & Services represent vendors that sell solutions and services to Defenders.
- Assessors represent specialties that measure or assess cybersecurity for Defenders (directly employed or as a service).
- Researchers represent specialties that do not directly support Defenders but seek to advance the cybersecurity industry.
